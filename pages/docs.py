# MacroAI - A Personalized Nutrition Recommendation System

## Idea

The main idea behind MacroAI is to leverage the power of machine learning to provide personalized nutrition recommendations. The system takes into account various factors such as a user's weight, height, age, and activity level to predict their daily protein intake.

## Problem Statement

Nutrition is a critical aspect of health, but it can be challenging for individuals to determine their optimal daily intake of various nutrients. While general guidelines exist, they do not take into account individual differences such as body weight, height, age, and activity level. Furthermore, understanding how changes in weight might affect nutritional needs over time is a complex problem that requires a data-driven approach.

## Solution

MacroAI addresses this problem by using a machine learning model trained on a dataset of nutritional recommendations. The model takes in a user's weight, height, age, and activity level as input and predicts their daily protein intake. The system also provides a visualization of how a user's protein intake might change as their weight changes over time.

## Impact

By providing personalized nutrition recommendations, MacroAI empowers users to make informed decisions about their diet and health. This could lead to improved health outcomes and a better understanding of the relationship between diet and health.
